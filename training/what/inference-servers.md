# Inference Servers

## What is an Inference Server?

An inference server is a specialized service that exposes trained AI models through standardized APIs, handling request management, scaling, and monitoring. It acts as the interface between client applications and the underlying model execution.

## Key Functions of Inference Servers

1. **API Exposure**: Provides HTTP/gRPC endpoints for model access
2. **Request Handling**: Manages incoming requests and queuing
3. **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across multiple model instances
4. **Model Management**: Handles model loading, unloading, and versioning
5. **Batching**: Combines multiple requests for efficient processing
6. **Monitoring**: Collects metrics on throughput, latency, and resource usage
7. **Resource Optimization**: Manages GPU memory and compute resources

## Deployment Patterns on EKS

### Standalone Deployment

Running the inference server directly as a Kubernetes deployment.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: triton-server
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: triton-server
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: triton-server
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: triton
        image: nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:23.04-py3
        resources:
          limits:
            nvidia.com/gpu: 1
```

### Operator-Based Deployment

Using Kubernetes operators for advanced management.

```yaml
apiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1beta1
kind: InferenceService
metadata:
  name: llm-service
spec:
  predictor:
    model:
      modelFormat:
        name: pytorch
      storageUri: s3://my-bucket/models/llm
      resources:
        limits:
          nvidia.com/gpu: 1
```

### Helm-Based Deployment

Using Helm charts for configurable deployments.

```bash
helm install triton-inference-server nvidia/triton-inference-server \
  --set image.tag=23.04-py3 \
  --set modelRepositoryPath=s3://my-bucket/models
```

## Considerations for EKS Deployment

1. **Resource Allocation**: Properly size CPU, memory, and GPU resources
2. **Autoscaling**: Configure HPA based on GPU utilization or custom metrics
3. **Networking**: Set appropriate timeouts for long-running inference requests
4. **Storage**: Configure fast access to model storage (FSx, EFS, S3)
5. **Security**: Implement proper authentication and network policies
6. **Monitoring**: Set up Prometheus and Grafana for observability
