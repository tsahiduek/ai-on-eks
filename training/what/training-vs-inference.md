# Training vs. Inference

Understanding the difference between model training and inference is crucial for designing effective AI/ML infrastructure on Amazon EKS.

## Model Training

Model training is the process of teaching a machine learning model to make predictions by showing it examples.

### Key Characteristics of Training

- **Compute Intensive**: Requires significant computational resources, often for extended periods
- **Batch Processing**: Processes large batches of data simultaneously
- **Iterative**: Involves multiple passes (epochs) through the training data
- **Stateful**: Maintains and updates model weights throughout the process
- **Write-Heavy**: Frequently updates model parameters and checkpoints

### Training Workflows

1. **Pre-training**: Initial training of foundation models on large datasets
2. **Fine-tuning**: Adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks with domain data
3. **Distributed Training**: Spreading training across multiple nodes for larger models
4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Tuning model parameters for optimal performance

### Training Infrastructure Requirements

- **High GPU/TPU/Trainium Capacity**: Multiple accelerators with high memory
- **High-Speed Interconnects**: For distributed training (e.g., EFA on AWS)
- **Large Storage Volumes**: For training datasets and checkpoints
- **Fault Tolerance**: Checkpoint mechanisms to resume training after failures

## Model Inference

Inference is the process of using a trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

### Key Characteristics of Inference

- **Latency Sensitive**: Often requires quick responses, especially for real-time applications
- **Stateless**: Generally doesn't update model weights during operation
- **Read-Heavy**: Loads model weights once, then processes many inputs
- **Variable Load**: May experience spikes and lulls in request volume
- **Optimized for Throughput or Latency**: Depending on use case

### Inference Patterns

1. **Real-time Inference**: Immediate responses to individual requests
2. **Batch Inference**: Processing multiple inputs at once for efficiency
3. **Streaming Inference**: Continuous processing of incoming data
4. **Edge Inference**: Running models on edge devices with limited resources

### Inference Infrastructure Requirements

- **Right-sized Accelerators**: GPUs/Inferentia matched to model requirements
- **Autoscaling**: Ability to scale with demand
- **Optimized Model Formats**: Quantized or distilled models for efficiency
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution of requests across multiple inference endpoints

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | Training | Inference |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Primary Goal | Minimize loss function | Minimize latency or maximize throughput |
| Duration | Hours to weeks | Milliseconds to seconds per request |
| Resource Usage | Consistent, high utilization | Variable, demand-based |
| Scaling Strategy | Scale up (vertical) | Scale out (horizontal) |
| Cost Profile | Fixed, predictable | Variable, usage-based |
| Optimization Focus | Convergence speed | Response time, throughput |
| Storage Access | Sequential, batch | Random access, small batches |

## EKS Considerations

### For Training Workloads

- Use node groups with GPU instances (e.g., p4d, p5) or AWS Trainium (Trn1)
- Configure node affinity and tolerations for specialized hardware
- Implement storage classes for high-throughput persistent volumes
- Consider using Karpenter for dynamic provisioning of training nodes
- Deploy distributed training frameworks like Kubeflow Training Operator

### For Inference Workloads

- Use autoscaling node groups with appropriate GPU or Inferentia instances
- Implement HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) for scaling based on demand
- Consider serverless inference with AWS Fargate for CPU-based models
- Use node anti-affinity to spread inference pods across nodes
- Deploy inference servers optimized for your model type
