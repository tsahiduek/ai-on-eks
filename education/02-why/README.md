## How to Use This Section

Each topic in this section follows a structured approach:

- **The Decision**: What choice needs to be made
- **Options Available**: Different approaches and their characteristics
- **Decision Criteria**: Factors to consider when making the choice
- **Trade-offs**: Pros and cons of each approach
- **Recommendations**: Guidance for different scenarios
- **Real-world Examples**: How these decisions play out in practice

## Decision Framework

When making architectural decisions for AI/ML on EKS, consider these key factors:

1. **Workload Characteristics**
   - Training vs. inference requirements
   - Model sizes and computational needs
   - Latency and throughput requirements
   - Batch vs. real-time processing needs

2. **Business Requirements**
   - Budget constraints and cost optimization needs
   - Compliance and security requirements
   - Scalability and growth projections
   - Time-to-market considerations

3. **Technical Constraints**
   - Existing infrastructure and skills
   - Integration requirements
   - Performance and reliability needs
   - Operational complexity tolerance

4. **Future Considerations**
   - Technology evolution and roadmap
   - Vendor lock-in concerns
   - Scalability and flexibility needs
   - Migration and portability requirements

## Integration with Repository Examples

Throughout this section, we reference practical implementations from this repository that demonstrate these architectural decisions in action:

- **Infrastructure Examples**: See how decisions are implemented in [/infra](../../infra) components
- **Blueprint Examples**: Observe architectural choices in [/blueprints](../../blueprints) implementations
- **Configuration Examples**: Review specific configurations that embody these decisions

After understanding the "why" behind these decisions, proceed to the ["How" section](../03-how/README.md) to learn about implementing these architectural choices, and then to the ["Hands-on" section](../04-hands-on/README.md) to practice making these decisions yourself.
