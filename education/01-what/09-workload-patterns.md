|---------|---------|------------|----------------|------|------------|
| Batch Training | High | High | Sustained | High | Medium |
| Batch Inference | Medium | Very High | Periodic | Medium | Low |

## Best Practices for Workload Patterns

1. **Match Infrastructure to Pattern**: Choose compute, storage, and networking based on workload characteristics
2. **Implement Appropriate Scaling**: Use different scaling strategies for different patterns
3. **Optimize for Cost**: Consider spot instances for fault-tolerant batch workloads
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track metrics relevant to each pattern type
5. **Plan for Failures**: Implement appropriate fault tolerance for each pattern
6. **Use Resource Quotas**: Prevent resource contention between different workload types
7. **Implement Security**: Apply appropriate security controls for each pattern
