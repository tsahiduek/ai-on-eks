## Hardware Selection Strategies

### Mixed Hardware Strategy

Use different hardware for different stages of the ML lifecycle:

```
Training (Trainium/GPU) → Model Optimization → Inference (Inferentia/GPU/CPU)
```

### Workload-Based Selection

Choose hardware based on specific workload characteristics:

- **Large Model Training**: P4d/P5 instances with NVIDIA A100/H100 GPUs
- **Cost-Optimized Training**: Trn1 instances with AWS Trainium
- **High-Performance Inference**: Inf2 instances with AWS Inferentia
- **Flexible Workloads**: G5 instances with NVIDIA A10G GPUs
- **Development and Testing**: CPU instances or G4dn with NVIDIA T4 GPUs

### Scaling Strategy

Implement auto-scaling based on workload demands:

- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: Scale pods based on metrics
- **Cluster Autoscaler**: Scale nodes based on pod demand
- **Karpenter**: Dynamic node provisioning based on workload requirements

## Best Practices for Hardware on EKS

1. **Right-Size Resources**: Match hardware to workload requirements
2. **Use Node Selectors and Taints**: Ensure pods land on appropriate hardware
3. **Implement Resource Quotas**: Prevent resource contention
4. **Monitor Utilization**: Track hardware usage to optimize costs
5. **Consider Spot Instances**: For fault-tolerant workloads to reduce costs
6. **Use GPU Sharing**: For better utilization of GPU resources
7. **Optimize Model for Hardware**: Quantize or compile models for specific hardware

## Example: Node Affinity for Hardware Selection

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gpu-inference
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: accelerator
            operator: In
            values:
            - nvidia-a100
  containers:
  - name: inference
    image: inference-image
    resources:
      limits:
        nvidia.com/gpu: 1
```
