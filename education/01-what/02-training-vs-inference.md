# Training vs. Inference

Understanding the difference between model training and inference is crucial for designing effective AI/ML infrastructure on Amazon EKS. These two phases have fundamentally different resource requirements, scaling patterns, and operational considerations.

## Model Training

Model training is the process of teaching a machine learning model to make predictions by showing it examples.

### Key Characteristics of Training

- **Compute Intensive**: Requires significant computational resources, often for extended periods
- **Batch Processing**: Processes large batches of data simultaneously
- **Iterative**: Involves multiple passes (epochs) through the training data
- **Stateful**: Maintains and updates model weights throughout the process
- **Write-Heavy**: Frequently updates model parameters and checkpoints

**Why this matters**: Training workloads typically run for hours, days, or even weeks, requiring sustained high performance and reliable infrastructure with minimal interruptions. They need the ability to resume from checkpoints if failures occur. From a business perspective, training represents a significant investment in compute resources and time, so infrastructure reliability directly impacts project timelines and costs. Failed training runs can set back development by days or weeks, making fault tolerance and proper resource planning critical for business success.

### Training Workflows

1. **Pre-training**: Initial training of foundation models on large datasets
   - **Infrastructure impact**: Requires massive compute clusters, often with specialized hardware like NVIDIA A100/H100 GPUs or AWS Trainium
   - **Duration**: Can take weeks to months

2. **Fine-tuning**: Adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks with domain data
   - **Infrastructure impact**: Requires less compute than pre-training but still benefits from accelerators
   - **Duration**: Hours to days depending on dataset size and model complexity

3. **Distributed Training**: Spreading training across multiple nodes for larger models
   - **Infrastructure impact**: Requires high-speed interconnects between nodes (like EFA on AWS)
   - **Scaling challenge**: Communication overhead increases with node count

4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Tuning model parameters for optimal performance
   - **Infrastructure impact**: Runs multiple training jobs in parallel
   - **Resource management**: Benefits from dynamic resource allocation

- [Kubeflow Training Operator](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/training/)

### Training Infrastructure Requirements

- **High GPU/TPU/Trainium Capacity**: Multiple accelerators with high memory
- **High-Speed Interconnects**: For distributed training (e.g., EFA on AWS)
- **Large Storage Volumes**: For training datasets and checkpoints
- **Fault Tolerance**: Checkpoint mechanisms to resume training after failures

**Why these requirements matter**: Properly sizing and configuring training infrastructure directly impacts training time, cost, and success rate. Undersized infrastructure can lead to out-of-memory errors or excessively long training times.

## Model Inference

Inference is the process of using a trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

### Key Characteristics of Inference

- **Latency Sensitive**: Often requires quick responses, especially for real-time applications
- **Stateless**: Inference processes never update model weights during operation. The model remains frozen and unchanged while processing requests. This is fundamentally different from training, where weights are constantly being updated. The "stateless" nature means each inference request is independent and doesn't affect the model or future requests.
- **Read-Heavy**: Loads model weights once, then processes many inputs
- **Variable Load**: May experience spikes (sudden increases) and lulls (quiet periods with few requests) in request volume. Unlike training which has consistent resource usage, inference workloads can be unpredictable - you might have thousands of requests during peak hours and very few during off-peak times.
- **Optimized for Throughput or Latency**: Inference systems are designed with different priorities depending on the use case. Latency-optimized systems prioritize fast response times (milliseconds) for real-time applications like chatbots or autonomous vehicles. Throughput-optimized systems prioritize processing as many requests as possible per second, even if individual requests take longer - this is common for batch processing or background tasks where speed of individual responses is less critical than overall volume processed.

**Why this matters**: Inference workloads need to be optimized for either low latency (real-time applications) or high throughput (batch processing). They also need to scale efficiently with demand to maintain performance while controlling costs. From a business perspective, inference is where you deliver value to users, so performance directly impacts user experience and customer satisfaction. Poor inference performance can lead to user churn, while over-provisioning wastes money on unused resources.

### Inference Patterns

1. **Real-time Inference**: Immediate responses to individual requests
   - **Use Case Examples**: Chatbots responding to user messages, fraud detection systems analyzing credit card transactions in real-time, autonomous vehicles making driving decisions, voice assistants processing speech commands
   - **Infrastructure impact**: Requires low-latency serving with appropriate timeout settings
   - **Scaling challenge**: Must handle unpredictable request patterns

2. **Batch Inference**: Processing multiple inputs at once for efficiency
   - **Use Case Examples**: Processing thousands of product images for an e-commerce catalog overnight, analyzing customer sentiment from daily email surveys, generating personalized recommendations for all users in a system, processing medical scans in bulk for a hospital system
   - **Infrastructure impact**: Optimized for throughput rather than latency
   - **Resource utilization**: Higher and more consistent GPU utilization

3. **Streaming Inference**: Continuous processing of incoming data
   - **Use Case Examples**: Real-time monitoring of manufacturing equipment for anomaly detection, processing live video feeds for security surveillance, analyzing social media streams for trending topics, monitoring IoT sensor data for predictive maintenance
   - **Infrastructure impact**: Requires integration with streaming platforms (systems that handle continuous data flows like Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis, or Apache Pulsar) that can buffer, route, and deliver data in real-time
   - **Scaling challenge**: Must handle variable data rates

4. **Edge Inference**: Running models on edge devices with limited resources
   - **Use Case Examples**: Smart cameras detecting objects without internet connectivity, mobile apps performing image recognition offline, industrial sensors making local decisions, autonomous drones processing visual data in real-time
   - **Infrastructure impact**: Requires model optimization (quantization, pruning)
   - **Deployment challenge**: Managing model updates across distributed devices

### Inference Infrastructure Requirements

- **Right-sized Accelerators**: GPUs/Inferentia matched to model requirements. Users can determine this by checking the model's memory requirements (usually specified in model documentation) and ensuring the GPU has sufficient VRAM. For example, a 7B parameter model typically needs 14-16GB of VRAM in FP16 format, so you'd need at least an A10G (24GB) or A100 (40GB/80GB) GPU. Tools like model cards on Hugging Face often specify minimum hardware requirements.
- **Autoscaling**: Ability to scale with demand
- **Optimized Model Formats**: Quantized or distilled models for efficiency
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution of requests across multiple inference endpoints

**Why these requirements matter**: Properly configured inference infrastructure ensures optimal performance while controlling costs. Over-provisioning wastes resources, while under-provisioning leads to poor user experience.

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | Training | Inference |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Primary Goal | Minimize loss function | Minimize latency or maximize throughput |
| Duration | Hours to weeks | Milliseconds to seconds per request |
| Resource Usage | Consistent, high utilization | Variable, demand-based |
| Scaling Strategy | Scale up (vertical) | Scale out (horizontal) |
| Cost Profile | Fixed, predictable | Variable, usage-based |
| Optimization Focus | Convergence speed | Response time, throughput |
| Storage Access | Sequential, batch | Random access, small batches |

**Why understanding these differences matters**: Training and inference have fundamentally different infrastructure requirements and operational patterns. Designing systems that account for these differences leads to more efficient and cost-effective AI deployments.

## EKS Considerations

### For Training Workloads

- Use node groups with GPU instances (e.g., p4d, p5, p5e, p6) or AWS Trainium (Trn1, Trn2) depending on your model size and performance requirements
- Configure node affinity and tolerations to target specific nodes using Kubernetes scheduling techniques, ensuring training workloads run on nodes with the appropriate specialized hardware (GPUs, Trainium chips)
- Implement storage classes for high-throughput persistent volumes
- Consider using Karpenter for dynamic provisioning of training nodes
- Deploy distributed training frameworks like Kubeflow Training Operator

**Why these considerations matter**: Training workloads benefit from specialized infrastructure that may be different from your standard Kubernetes workloads. Proper configuration ensures efficient resource utilization and reliable training jobs. From a business perspective, training infrastructure directly impacts development velocity and costs - well-configured training environments can reduce training time from weeks to days, while poor configuration can lead to failed jobs and wasted resources.

### For Inference Workloads

- Use Karpenter for dynamic node provisioning with appropriate GPU (g4dn, g5, p4d, p5) or Inferentia (inf1, inf2) instances. While autoscaling works with Managed Node Groups, Karpenter is simpler to operate and can leverage a more diverse range of instance types for cost optimization and availability
- Implement HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) for scaling inference serving pods based on demand metrics like CPU utilization, GPU utilization, or custom metrics like request queue length
- Consider EKS Auto Mode for serverless inference with CPU-based models, which provides better resource management and cost optimization compared to Fargate
- Use node anti-affinity to spread inference pods across nodes for high availability and fault tolerance. While resource requirements are indeed the primary limiting factor, spreading pods across nodes ensures that if one node fails, your inference service remains available. This is particularly important for production inference endpoints where uptime is critical.
- Deploy inference servers optimized for your model type

**Why these considerations matter**: Inference workloads need to balance performance, cost, and reliability. Proper autoscaling and resource allocation ensure that your inference endpoints can handle variable load while maintaining performance and controlling costs. From a business perspective, inference is your revenue-generating component - users interact with inference endpoints, not training jobs. Poor inference performance directly impacts user experience, customer satisfaction, and ultimately business success.
