# Summary: Foundational Concepts for AI on EKS

This summary ties together all the foundational concepts covered in the "What" section, providing a comprehensive overview of the components and considerations for running AI/ML workloads on Amazon EKS.

## Key Concepts Recap

### 1. AI/ML Models ([Detailed Guide](01-models.md))

**What You Learned:**
- Different types of models (foundation models, task-specific, embedding models)
- Model architectures (Transformers, CNNs, Diffusion models)
- Model sizes and their infrastructure implications
- Model formats and optimization techniques

**Key Takeaway for Infrastructure:**
Model size and type directly determine your infrastructure requirements. A 70B parameter LLM needs very different resources than a small image classification model.

### 2. Training vs. Inference ([Detailed Guide](02-training-vs-inference.md))

**What You Learned:**
- Training is compute-intensive, batch-oriented, and stateful
- Inference is latency-sensitive, stateless, and variable-load
- Different scaling strategies for each phase
- EKS considerations for both workload types

**Key Takeaway for Infrastructure:**
Training and inference have fundamentally different resource patterns and scaling requirements. Design your infrastructure to handle both efficiently.

### 3. Frameworks and Ecosystem ([Detailed Guide](03-frameworks-ecosystem.md))

**What You Learned:**
- PyTorch dominates AI/ML with dynamic computation graphs
- TensorFlow offers production-ready deployment tools
- JAX provides high-performance research capabilities
- Specialized libraries for specific domains (computer vision, NLP)
- Container strategies and Kubernetes integration patterns

**Key Takeaway for Infrastructure:**
Framework choice impacts container images, dependencies, and deployment patterns. Understanding framework characteristics helps optimize infrastructure decisions.

### 5. Inference Servers ([Detailed Guide](05-inference-servers.md))

**What You Learned:**
- Ray Serve for Python-centric workflows
- NVIDIA Triton for multi-framework serving
- vLLM Serving for LLM-specific optimization
- KServe for Kubernetes-native serving
- TorchServe for PyTorch models

**Key Takeaway for Infrastructure:**
Inference servers provide the API layer and operational features needed for production deployment. They handle scaling, monitoring, and request management.

### 6. Distributed Computing ([Detailed Guide](06-distributed-computing.md))

**What You Learned:**
- Ray ecosystem for comprehensive distributed computing
- PyTorch Distributed for native PyTorch scaling
- Different parallelism strategies (data, model, pipeline, tensor)
- KubeRay for Ray on Kubernetes

**Key Takeaway for Infrastructure:**
Modern AI workloads often require distributed computing. Understanding the different approaches helps you choose the right strategy for your use case.

### 7. Storage Solutions ([Detailed Guide](07-storage-solutions.md))

**What You Learned:**
- FSx for Lustre for high-performance training
- EFS for shared model repositories
- S3 for long-term storage and datasets
- Instance storage for temporary high-speed access

**Key Takeaway for Infrastructure:**
Storage performance is often the bottleneck in AI workloads. Match storage type to access patterns and performance requirements.

### 8. Hardware Options ([Detailed Guide](08-hardware-options.md))

**What You Learned:**
- NVIDIA GPUs for versatile AI acceleration
- AWS Trainium for cost-effective training
- AWS Inferentia for optimized inference
- CPU instances for specific use cases

**Key Takeaway for Infrastructure:**
Hardware choice significantly impacts both performance and cost. Consider workload characteristics when selecting accelerators.

### 9. Workload Patterns ([Detailed Guide](09-workload-patterns.md))

**What You Learned:**
- Batch processing patterns for training and bulk inference
- Real-time serving patterns for interactive applications
- Interactive development patterns for experimentation
- Streaming and event-driven patterns for real-time processing

**Key Takeaway for Infrastructure:**
Different workload patterns have different infrastructure requirements. Design your EKS cluster to support multiple patterns efficiently.

## Infrastructure Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to make informed decisions about your AI/ML infrastructure on EKS:

| Consideration | Small Models (<1B params) | Medium Models (1B-10B) | Large Models (10B-100B) | Very Large Models (>100B) |
|---------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Hardware** | CPU/T4 GPUs | A10G/V100 GPUs | A100 GPUs | Multiple A100/H100 nodes |
| **Storage** | EFS/S3 | EFS/FSx | FSx for Lustre | FSx for Lustre + S3 |
| **Inference Library** | Transformers/ONNX | vLLM/TensorRT | vLLM/TensorRT-LLM | vLLM with tensor parallelism |
| **Serving** | TorchServe/KServe | Triton/vLLM Serve | vLLM Serve/Triton | Distributed serving |
| **Training** | Single GPU | Multi-GPU DDP | Multi-node training | Distributed with Ray/Horovod |

## Common Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Research and Development
```
JupyterHub → Experiment Tracking (MLflow) → Model Registry → Simple Serving
```

### Pattern 2: Production LLM Serving
```
Model Storage (S3) → Model Loading (FSx) → vLLM Serving → Load Balancer
```
- **Hardware**: GPU instances (A100/H100)

- **Focus**: High throughput and low latency

### Pattern 3: Large-Scale Training
```
Dataset (S3) → High-Speed Storage (FSx) → Distributed Training → Checkpoints (S3)
```
- **Hardware**: Multi-node GPU or Trainium clusters
- **Storage**: FSx for Lustre for training data
- **Focus**: Training efficiency and fault tolerance

### Pattern 4: Multi-Model Production
```
Model Registry → NVIDIA Triton → Auto-scaling → Monitoring
```
- **Hardware**: Mixed GPU instances
- **Storage**: EFS for model repository
- **Focus**: Operational efficiency and resource sharing

## Key Principles for AI on EKS

1. **Right-Size Resources**: Match compute, storage, and networking to workload requirements
2. **Plan for Scale**: Design for both horizontal and vertical scaling
3. **Optimize for Cost**: Use appropriate instance types and scaling strategies
4. **Monitor Everything**: Implement comprehensive observability
5. **Automate Operations**: Use GitOps and automation for reliability
6. **Security First**: Implement proper access controls and network policies
7. **Plan for Failure**: Design fault-tolerant systems with proper backup strategies

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Under-sizing GPU Memory**: Ensure sufficient GPU memory for your models
2. **Ignoring Storage Performance**: Don't let storage become the bottleneck
3. **Over-provisioning Resources**: Right-size to avoid unnecessary costs
4. **Neglecting Monitoring**: Implement proper observability from the start
5. **Mixing Workload Types**: Separate training and inference workloads appropriately
6. **Ignoring Security**: Implement proper access controls and network policies
7. **Not Planning for Updates**: Have strategies for model and infrastructure updates
