# Inference Libraries and Backends

Inference libraries and backends are specialized software components that optimize the execution of AI models during inference. They serve as the bridge between the model architecture and the underlying hardware.

## What is an Inference Library?

An inference library is a software package that provides optimized implementations of operations required for model inference. These libraries handle:

- Efficient tensor operations
- Memory management
- Hardware acceleration
- Batching strategies
- Model optimization techniques

## Choosing the Right Inference Library

Consider these factors when selecting an inference library for your EKS deployment:

1. **Model Size and Type**: Different libraries excel with different model sizes and architectures
2. **Hardware Availability**: Match the library to your available hardware
3. **Performance Requirements**: Latency vs. throughput needs
4. **Operational Complexity**: Some libraries require more expertise to configure optimally
5. **Integration Needs**: How the library works with your existing stack

## Inference Backends vs. Inference Servers

- **Inference Backend**: The underlying library that executes the model (e.g., vLLM, TensorRT-LLM)
- **Inference Server**: A service that exposes models via APIs and handles request management (e.g., Triton, TorchServe)

Many inference servers can use different backends depending on the model type and requirements.
