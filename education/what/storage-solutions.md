# Storage Solutions for AI/ML

Effective storage is critical for AI/ML workloads on Amazon EKS. Different storage solutions offer varying performance characteristics, accessibility patterns, and cost structures that make them suitable for different aspects of the AI/ML lifecycle.

## Storage Requirements for AI/ML Workloads

AI/ML workloads have unique storage requirements:

1. **High Throughput**: For loading large models and datasets
2. **Low Latency**: For real-time inference and interactive training
3. **Scalability**: To handle growing model sizes and datasets
4. **Shared Access**: For distributed training across multiple nodes
5. **Versioning**: To track different model versions and datasets
6. **Cost Efficiency**: To manage storage costs for large datasets and models

## Amazon FSx for Lustre

A high-performance file system optimized for compute-intensive workloads.

### Key Features

- **High Throughput**: Hundreds of GB/s throughput and millions of IOPS
- **POSIX Compliant**: Works with standard file system operations
- **S3 Integration**: Seamless data loading from S3
- **Scalability**: Scale up to hundreds of GB/s of throughput
- **Persistent or Scratch**: Options for different durability needs

### When to Use FSx for Lustre

- **Training Large Models**: When high throughput is required for loading large datasets
- **Distributed Training**: When multiple nodes need shared access to the same data
- **Model Hosting**: For large models that require high-performance file access
- **Data Processing**: For ETL workloads that process large amounts of data

### Example EKS Integration

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: fsx-lustre
provisioner: fsx.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  deploymentType: PERSISTENT_1
  automaticBackupRetentionDays: "1"
  dailyAutomaticBackupStartTime: "00:00"
  perUnitStorageThroughput: "200"
  dataCompressionType: "NONE"
```

## Amazon EFS

A scalable, elastic file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.

### Key Features

- **Elastic**: Automatically grows and shrinks as files are added and removed
- **Shared Access**: Multiple EC2 instances can access the file system
- **Durability**: Stores data redundantly across multiple AZs
- **Performance Modes**: General Purpose and Max I/O options
- **Throughput Modes**: Bursting and Provisioned options

### When to Use EFS

- **Shared Model Repository**: When multiple nodes need access to the same models
- **Persistent Storage**: For long-term storage of models and datasets
- **Cross-AZ Access**: When workloads span multiple availability zones
- **Medium-sized Models**: For models that don't require extreme throughput

### Example EKS Integration

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: efs-sc
provisioner: efs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  provisioningMode: efs-ap
  fileSystemId: fs-0123456789abcdef0
  directoryPerms: "700"
```

## Amazon S3

Object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

### Key Features

- **Virtually Unlimited Storage**: Scales to store any amount of data
- **High Durability**: 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability
- **Versioning**: Track and restore previous versions of objects
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automatically transition objects between storage classes
- **Event Notifications**: Trigger workflows based on object changes

### When to Use S3

- **Dataset Storage**: For long-term storage of training datasets
- **Model Artifacts**: For storing trained model artifacts
- **Checkpoints**: For saving training checkpoints
- **Cold Storage**: For infrequently accessed data with S3 Glacier
- **Public Datasets**: For sharing datasets with the community

### Example EKS Integration

```python
# Using the AWS SDK to access S3 from within a pod
import boto3

s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
s3_client.download_file('my-bucket', 'model.pt', '/tmp/model.pt')
```

## Instance Storage

NVMe-based SSD storage physically attached to the host server.

### Key Features

- **Very Low Latency**: Direct attached storage with minimal latency
- **High IOPS**: Hundreds of thousands of IOPS
- **Ephemeral**: Data is lost when the instance stops
- **No Extra Cost**: Included with the instance price

### When to Use Instance Storage

- **Temporary Datasets**: For preprocessing data before training
- **Caching**: For caching frequently accessed data
- **Scratch Space**: For intermediate results during computation
- **Local Checkpoints**: For frequent checkpointing with later sync to durable storage

### Example EKS Integration

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ml-training
spec:
  containers:
  - name: training
    image: training-image
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /scratch
      name: scratch-volume
  volumes:
  - name: scratch-volume
    hostPath:
      path: /local-ssd
      type: DirectoryOrCreate
```

## Comparison of Storage Solutions

| Feature | FSx for Lustre | EFS | S3 | Instance Storage |
|---------|----------------|-----|----|--------------------|
| Access Pattern | File System | File System | Object | File System |
| Performance | Very High | Medium-High | Medium | Very High |
| Durability | High | Very High | Highest | None |
| Scalability | High | Very High | Unlimited | Limited |
| Cost | Higher | Medium | Lower | Included with instance |
| Use Case | High-performance training | Shared model repository | Long-term storage | Temporary processing |

## Storage Patterns for AI/ML on EKS

### Model Repository Pattern

Store models in S3, with a cache layer using EFS or FSx for faster access.

```
S3 (Model Storage) → EFS/FSx (Cache) → Inference Pods
```

### Training Checkpoint Pattern

Use instance storage for frequent checkpoints, with periodic syncs to S3 for durability.

```
Instance Storage (Frequent Checkpoints) → S3 (Durable Checkpoints)
```

### Distributed Dataset Pattern

Store the dataset in FSx for Lustre with data loaded from S3.

```
S3 (Raw Data) → FSx for Lustre (Training Access) → Training Pods
```

## Best Practices for AI/ML Storage on EKS

1. **Match Storage to Workload**: Choose the right storage solution based on performance needs
2. **Use Storage Classes**: Define Kubernetes StorageClasses for different storage types
3. **Consider Data Locality**: Place compute close to data when possible
4. **Implement Caching**: Use faster storage as a cache for frequently accessed data
5. **Monitor Performance**: Track storage metrics to identify bottlenecks
6. **Optimize Costs**: Use lifecycle policies to move data to cheaper storage tiers
7. **Plan for Scaling**: Ensure storage can scale with your workloads
