## How to Use This Section

Each guide in this section follows a practical, hands-on approach:

- **Prerequisites**: What you need before starting
- **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Detailed implementation steps
- **Configuration Examples**: Real YAML and code examples
- **Verification Steps**: How to confirm everything works
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
- **Next Steps**: What to do after completion

## Prerequisites

Before starting with these guides, ensure you have:

### Required Tools
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- kubectl installed and configured
- Terraform (for infrastructure provisioning)
- Docker (for container operations)
- Helm (for package management)

### AWS Permissions
Your AWS credentials should have permissions for:
- EKS cluster management
- EC2 instance and VPC operations
- IAM role and policy management
- S3 and storage service access
- CloudWatch and monitoring services

### Knowledge Requirements
- Basic Kubernetes concepts and operations
- Understanding of containerization and Docker
- Familiarity with AWS services
- Basic networking concepts

## Repository Integration

These guides extensively reference and build upon the examples in this repository:

- **Infrastructure Code**: Located in [/infra](../../infra) directory
- **Blueprint Examples**: Found in [/blueprints](../../blueprints) directory
- **Configuration Templates**: Available throughout the repository

Each guide will show you how to:
1. Use existing repository components
2. Customize them for your needs
3. Deploy and configure them properly
4. Monitor and maintain them

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Guides 1-3)
Start with cluster setup, then deploy either inference or training workloads based on your immediate needs.

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Guides 4-6)
Add storage, specialized hardware, and security configurations as your requirements grow.

### Phase 3: Production (Guides 7-9)
Implement monitoring, CI/CD, and scaling for production-ready deployments.

### Phase 4: Operations (Guide 10)
Learn troubleshooting and maintenance for ongoing operations.

## Getting Started

1. **Start with [Cluster Setup](01-cluster-setup.md)** to establish your foundation
2. **Choose your workload path**:
   - For inference: Go to [Inference Deployment](02-inference-deployment.md)
   - For training: Go to [Training Setup](03-training-setup.md)
3. **Add supporting services** as needed from guides 4-9
4. **Reference [Troubleshooting](10-troubleshooting.md)** when issues arise

## Support and Community

- **Issues**: Report problems in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/awslabs/ai-on-eks/issues)
- **Discussions**: Join conversations in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/awslabs/ai-on-eks/discussions)
- **Documentation**: Refer to the [AI on EKS website](https://awslabs.github.io/ai-on-eks/)

After completing these implementation guides, proceed to the ["Hands-on" section](../04-hands-on/README.md) to practice with real-world scenarios and challenges.
